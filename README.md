# rust_quiz

This is a simple CLI quiz runner, with written for no real reason other than to
learn Rust. As such it will most likely be riddled with amateur mistakes.

Hopefully over time there will be less...

It also has an unnecessarily 'complex' branching setup for a personal project
that no-one will ever contribute to, so I can learn more about running repos.
